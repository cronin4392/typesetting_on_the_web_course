                        <p class="header-dek">T La Rock was one of the pioneers of hip-hop, an old-school legend sampled by Public Enemy and Nas. But after a brutal attack put him in a nursing home, he had to fight to recover his identity, starting with the fact that he’d ever been a rapper at all.</p>

                <p>He was nervous. He hadn’t been onstage since the accident. Here he was, 34 years old, a veteran performer, but he felt like an anxious teenager, picking up a microphone for the first time. Would he find the words? He felt somewhat reassured when he summoned the rhythm in his head. He’d approached the mic a thousand times before, first on street corners and in clubs in New York and later on stages around the world. But he surely never anticipated performing in this venue—the rec room and sometimes synagogue of the Haym Salomon Home for Nursing and Rehabilitation near Coney Island, Brooklyn.</p>

                <p>Above the makeshift stage hung a long sheet of butcher paper, heralding the HAYM SALOMON TALENT SHOW in bubble letters. After a resident named Betty finished reading poems from her grandchildren, it was his turn to take the stage. He cut an odd figure up there: a six-foot-three former rap legend in a tracksuit, sweating from nerves in front of a room full of frail senior citizens. He may have seemed like a strange booking choice for Haym Salomon—but in fact, he felt right at home. Because he was home. “Please welcome,” the announcer said, “our very own musical maestro, the one and only T La Rock!”</p>

                <p>The crowd waited. Some were asleep in their wheelchairs. A few no longer knew their own names. But those who were alert and awake were in quite a festive mood. They tapped their feet as the music started, waving at their fellow resident.</p>

                <p>T had been living at Haym Salomon for some time, recovering from a traumatic head injury. Two years earlier, on April 1, 1994, he had been attacked on the street near his house in the Bronx. By the time he got to the hospital, he had slipped into a coma.</p>

                <p>The doctors later said T had transient global amnesia, and when he was moved to Haym Salomon—it was one of the few facilities in the five boroughs that could accommodate his kind of injury—he thought at first that he had wound up in some kind of purgatory hotel. His rehabilitation, the doctors warned, would be a long road.</p>

                <p>The other residents were mostly elderly Jews, Yiddish speakers whose families had emigrated from the Pale of Settlement. T was from the Bronx, and he had been a direct witness to the birth of hip-hop; ten years earlier, his single “It’s Yours” was the very first hip-hop recording released by Def Jam, hashed out with Rick Rubin in his dorm at N.Y.U. That song became a hit, inspired a whole new sound in rap music, and placed T at the lead of a seismic cultural force. Many of T’s fellow patients knew he was a rapper or singer or something (“That nice boy from the third ﬂoor? They said he was a superstar.” “Yeah, right”), but this was his first chance to show them.</p>

                <p>It was, as they say, a warm room. T looked around and saw that everyone was there: Bernie and Leon, rolling back and forth in their chairs; Norma and Sophie and Betty down in front; and on the sidelines, Marshall and Sheila, clapping for him. He’d had to painstakingly re-memorize his rap, a medley of hits from his glory days. At the edge of the stage, a student volunteer started beatboxing, and when T found his way into the rhythm, his confidence swelled. He felt that familiar feeling, the declarative pose of street corners in the Bronx, the self-assurance of a youthful yearning for a place in the world, and as the beat rolled to the edge of the verse it was by instinct that T La Rock reached for the microphone.</p>

                <p>I’d heard about T La Rock and his strange fish-out-of-water story from a friend who’d stumbled across an article about him published in The New York Times in 1996, when the rapper still lived in the nursing home. That brief mention made me want to find out more about what his life was like at Haym Salomon. I tracked T down and talked to him at length, along with his family and the former staff of the nursing home, to understand how he had re-discovered himself. There was some irony in T’s predicament, since so much of his music was about identity: proclamatory, sometimes prideful, singing a song of oneself. And yet, T could barely summon a self to sing about.</p>

                <p>The head injury he’d suffered, an acute subdural hematoma, often leads to severe and lasting memory loss. When he was first brought to the hospital, his doctors had been unsure if he would survive, even as they tried to save him. At one point, T’s family was told to call a priest.</p>

                <p>The swelling in T’s brain affected his hippocampus, the seat of long-term memory, which was why when he finally did open his eyes one day, shocking the critical-care nurse on duty, he was profoundly disoriented, and his mother, Sylvia, who had stood vigil for weeks, leaned over the bed to gently remind him of his name. “You’re Terrence Keaton,” she said. “You’re 32 years old. And I’m your mother.” Members of his family also stood by his hospital bed, but he wasn’t sure who they were. When he saw one of his brothers, T pointed at him and asked, “Who’s this?”</p>

                <p>“It’s me—Tone,” his brother Anthony said. He was the youngest of the six Keaton kids.</p>

                <p>“Where’s June?” T asked.</p>

                <p>His mother stayed quiet. She exchanged looks with Tone.</p>

                <p>“June?” T said again, referring to Daniel Jr., his eldest brother. But June had been dead for years, shot on the street in the Bronx.</p>

                <p>At one point, the doctors thought T would be permanently disabled, and they tried to put him in a mental hospital. But Sylvia, a sixth-grade teacher, was a determined woman, and she made sure that T was not warehoused in the bowels of Bellevue but went to a place where he could recover. Haym Salomon was on the opposite end of the city from the Bronx, but every day she took the train there—an hour each way—to sit by T’s side. For a couple of weeks, he didn’t leave his room. When T was eventually taken out to see therapy specialists on other floors, T found a drab building full of pale, creased faces.</p>

                <p>“What kind of place is this?” T asked Sylvia.</p>

                <p>“You’re in a nursing home,” she said.</p>
